# Challenge 5: Unit Testing

Instructions: 

Write unit tests for the `TaskList` component from Challenge 1. Use a testing library of your choice (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) to ensure that the component renders correctly, handles completed tasks properly, and verifies that it displays the correct number of tasks. 

 

Specifications: 

- Write test cases to ensure that the `TaskList` component renders correctly with different sets of `tasks` props. 

- Write test cases to check if completed tasks are styled appropriately (e.g., CSS style is applied for completed tasks). 

- Write test cases to verify that the correct number of tasks is displayed when the component receives different sets of `tasks` props. 

- Ensure that the component handles edge cases gracefully (e.g., rendering when no tasks are passed).
