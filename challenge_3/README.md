# Challenge 3: Form Validation

Instructions: 

Build a React form component called `RegistrationForm` that allows users to sign up for an account. The form should have fields for `username`, `email`, `password`, and `confirm password`. Implement client-side validation to ensure that all fields are filled out correctly (e.g., valid email format, matching passwords). Display appropriate error messages if validation fails. 

 

Specifications: 

- Create a new React component named `RegistrationForm.js`. 

- The form should have input fields for `username`, `email`, `password`, and `confirm password`. 

- Implement client-side validation for each field, ensuring that they are not empty and meet specific requirements (e.g., valid email format, password length). 

- Display error messages below each input field if validation fails, explaining the reason for the validation error. 

- Disable the form submission button if any validation errors exist. 

- When the form is successfully submitted, log the form data to the console.
